# TBB Training Ledger
## Sneak peek to Chapter 13
You will build all of this from scratch! Follow the next 4 steps and you will be connected to the TBB testing blockchain network in 30 seconds.

### 1/4 Check the current blockchain network status
Go ahead. Try it right now! :cupid:

```bash

# Introduction

Hi :wave:,

With Web 3.0 and blockchain becoming more mainstream every day, do you know what blockchain is? Do you know its technical advantages and use-cases?

**The goal of this tutorial is to introduce blockchain technology from a technical perspective by building one from scratch.**

Forget everything you've heard about blockchain from social media. Now, you will build a blockchain system from ground zero to really understand the ins and outs of this peer-to-peer, distributed technology.

Afterwards, make your own mind up about its future, advantages and shortcomings. 

Spoiler alert: you will fall in love with programming blockchain software. :smiling_imp:

## How?

You will follow the story of a software developer who is looking to revolutionize his local bar by implementing blockchain technology for its payment system.

Although blockchain has several undeniable use-cases, at the moment, the number one application is payments. This is because banks are still running on an inefficient, 40 year old infrastructure powered by CSV files and FTP.

The story comes with a lot of fun and intriguing facts about the overall blockchain ecosystem and different protocols such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP.

## What will you build?

Chapter by chapter, you will build a full peer-to-peer, autonomous training blockchain system in Go and **learn all standard blockchain components!**

**Note: This codebase is only for educational (training, learning) purposes. Do not use this code in production.**

### 1) You will build a peer-to-peer system from scratch

You start with 0 lines of code and end-up with 13+ branches with complete executable source-code.

PS: Don't worry if nothing on the screen makes sense yet, it will once you go chapter by chapter; release by release.

![peer-to-peer blockchain system in action](public/img/andrej_babayaga_caesar_sync_p2p.png)

### 2) You will secure the system with a day-to-day practical cryptography

No boring theory. Only modern practices.

![elliptic curve cryptography](public/img/andrej_babayaga_crypto_sign_summary.png)

### 3) You will implement Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP backend components 

From diagrams of mining algorithms to actual, implemented and working crypto wallets for storing the mined tokens and all other fundamental components that make blockchain special.

![decentralized consensus](public/img/mining_p2p.png)

### 4) You will write unit tests and integration tests for all core components

You will test your cryptographic functions, a Bitcoin's like Proof of Work mining algorithm and other key components.

# Usage

## Install
```
go install ./cmd/...
```

## CLI
### Show available commands and flags
```bash
tbb help
```

#### Show available run settings
```bash
tbb run --help

Launches the TBB node and its HTTP API.

Usage:
  tbb run [flags]

Flags:
      --bootstrap-account string   default bootstrap Web3Coach's Genesis account with 1M TBB tokens (default "0x09ee50f2f37fcba1845de6fe5c762e83e65e755c")
      --bootstrap-ip string        default bootstrap Web3Coach's server to interconnect peers (default "node.tbb.web3.coach")
      --bootstrap-port uint        default bootstrap Web3Coach's server port to interconnect peers (default 443)
      --datadir string             Absolute path to your node's data dir where the DB will be/is stored
      --disable-ssl                should the HTTP API SSL certificate be disabled? (default false)
  -h, --help                       help for run
      --ip string                  your node's public IP to communication with other peers (default "127.0.0.1")
      --miner string               your node's miner account to receive the block rewards (default "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
      --port uint                  your node's public HTTP port for communication with other peers (configurable if SSL is disabled) (default 443)
```

### Run a TBB node connected to the official book's test network 
If you are running the node on your localhost, disable the SSL with `--disable-ssl` flag.

```
tbb version
> Version: 1.3.2-alpha 564d63 TX Ga

tbb run --datadir=$HOME/.tbb --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8081 --miner=0x_YOUR_WALLET_ACCOUNT --disable-ssl
```

### Run a TBB bootstrap node in isolation, on your localhost only
```
tbb run --datadir=$HOME/.tbb_boostrap --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8080 --bootstrap-ip=127.0.0.1 --bootstrap-port=8080 --disable-ssl
```

#### Run a second TBB node connecting to your first one
```
tbb run --datadir=$HOME/.tbb --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8081 --bootstrap-ip=127.0.0.1 --bootstrap-port=8080 --disable-ssl
```

### Create a new account
```
tbb wallet new-account --datadir=$HOME/.tbb 
```

### Run a TBB node with SSL
The default node's HTTP port is 443. The SSL certificate is generated automatically as long as the DNS A/AAAA records point at your server.

#### Official Testing Bootstrap Server
Example how the official TBB bootstrap node is launched. Customize the `--datadir`, `--miner`, and `--ip` values to match your server.

```bash
/usr/local/bin/tbb run --datadir=/home/ec2-user/.tbb --miner=0x09ee50f2f37fcba1845de6fe5c762e83e65e755c --ip=node.tbb.web3.coach --port=443 --ssl-email=lukas@web3.coach --bootstrap-ip=node.tbb.web3.coach --bootstrap-port=443 --bootstrap-account=0x09ee50f2f37fcba1845de6fe5c762e83e65e755c
```

## HTTP
### List all balances
```
curl http://localhost:8080/balances/list | jq
```

### Send a signed TX
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/tx/add' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"from": "0x22ba1f80452e6220c7cc6ea2d1e3eeddac5f694a",
	"from_pwd": "security123",
	"to": "0x6fdc0d8d15ae6b4ebf45c52fd2aafbcbb19a65c8",
	"value": 100
}'
```

### Check node's status (latest block, known peers, pending TXs)
```
curl http://localhost:8080/node/status | jq
```

## Tests
Run all tests with verbosity but one at a time, without timeout, to avoid ports collisions:
```
go test -v -p=1 -timeout=0 ./...
```

Run an individual test:
```
go test -timeout=0 ./node -test.v -test.run ^TestNode_Mining$
```

**Note:** Majority are integration tests and take time. Expect the test suite to finish in ~30 mins.
